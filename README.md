Iris Flower Classification using Decision Tree Classifier

Predict the different species of flowers on the length of there petals and sepals.

For this problem we will be using Iris Flower Data, the data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.

To train our machine learning model with Iris Flowe Data, we will be using scikit-learnâ€™s iris dataset.
